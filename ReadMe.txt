Files included: AirBnB Project Code

This code loads data concerning AirBnB's thorughout different areas of New York. 
We wanted to know if the price was affected by the minimum nights.
We also tested to see if the neighbourhoods of Manhattan and Brooklyn differed in price.
The graphs displayed in this code are exploring the data and examining different variables. 
There is a scatterplot that examines the relationship between price and minimum nights, 
a barchart that shows the frequecy of each neighbourhood in the dataset, a boxplot
that displays the relationship between room type and price and the linear regression 
plot of price and minimum nights. This code also gives us the linear regression results
 and t-test results.
